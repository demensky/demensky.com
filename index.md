## Experience

### Room4

**2019.12 – 2022.02.**

Development of Twitch extensions, Admin pages and websites. Working with
JSON-RPC like protocol over WebSocket. Using a mono-repository, isomorphic and
strictly type-safe code.

### Citrus

**2018.10 — 2019.01.**

Improvement of the online store.

### Synebo

**2018.08 — 2018.09.**

Admin panel in which you can see detailed statistics about the service provided.

### [Andersen](https://www.andersenlab.com/)

**2016.12 — 2018.07.**

Development of UI libraries using Angular framework which includes components
and directives intended to be used by developers from the related teams.

All components were developed using the `OnPush` strategy and immutable data.
`<ng-template>` was actively used to customize components, which eliminated the
need to create similar components with the same functionality, but different
content.

### [HostingMaks](http://hostingmaks.com/)

**2013.09 — 2016.11.**

#### Unit tests for server API

Writing tests to verify the server API. First time using
[TypeScript][typescript] for non-personal purposes, it got rid of typos and
reduced debugging sessions.

#### Admin panel for platform module

Page embedded through iframe in other platforms. It allowed to automate the work
of site owners with social networks. First introduced to
[observables][knockout-observables] (not [rxjs][rxjs]).

#### Layout/improvement of sites on a ready-made platform

The platform options were: Dex Media (EasySiteWizard), CM4all and sometimes just
static sites.
