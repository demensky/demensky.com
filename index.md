**Stack**: [Angular] and [RxJS].

Development of UI libraries using Angular framework which includes components
and directives intended to be used by developers from the related teams.

All components were developed using the `OnPush` strategy and immutable data.
`<ng-template>` was actively used to customize components, which eliminated the
need to create similar components with the same functionality, but different
content.

### [HostingMaks](http://hostingmaks.com/)

**2013.09 — 2016.11.**

**Stack**: [Knockout.js][knockout].

#### Unit tests for server API

Writing tests to verify the server API. First time using
[TypeScript][typescript] for non-personal purposes, it got rid of typos and
reduced debugging sessions.

#### Admin panel for platform module

Page embedded through iframe in other platforms. It allowed to automate the work
of site owners with social networks. First introduced to
[observables][knockout-observables] (not [rxjs][rxjs]).

#### Layout/improvement of sites on a ready-made platform

The platform options were: Dex Media (EasySiteWizard), CM4all and sometimes just
static sites.
